[Quanto Engineering Application] - Accounting and finance isn't just about the numbers. So WealthSmart takes that to heart by contextualizing its financial predicitons and analysis with thousands the most recent news articles! This was an additional project I made for the application, and now substitutes as the take-home assignment.

# Inspiration

When I first learned about Quanto during my job hunt, what I really caught my eye was the landing page saying "Stress-Free Financials" and tips for small businesses. So then I began digging deeper. I found that Quanto used technologies such as Xero which had a financial forecasting, but did not seem to take into account data from the news.ðŸ’¡! Right there and then, a light bulb appeared above my head and hoped right onto VS code to get my ideas out.
