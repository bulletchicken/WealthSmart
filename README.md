# Overview

[Quanto Engineering Application] - If everything were just 1s and 0s, the world would be boring—no pop music, no socializing, and definitely no Instagram Reels. These are the things in life that make us, well, human. And that goes for accounting and finance too! It's not all just about the numbers. People have always been influenced because of opinions, creativity, and of course, the latest news! So WealthSmart takes this idea to heart by contextualizing its financial predicitons and analysis with thousands the most recent news articles! This was an additional project I made for the application, and now serves as the take-home assignment.

# Inspiration

When I first learned about Quanto during my job hunt, what I really caught my eye was the landing page saying "Stress-Free Financials" and tips for small businesses. Something in my head flickered because my parents run a small business together 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒 and I always see them up at 2am doing their own accounting on a crappy computer running Microsoft Excel (they pull me in to help out too). So, I dug deeper. I found that Quanto used technologies such as Xero which had a financial forecasting, but did not seem to take into account data from the news.💡! Right there and then, the flickering light bulb went full bright and appeared above my head. Of course knowing me, I hoped right onto VS code to bring my idea to life.
